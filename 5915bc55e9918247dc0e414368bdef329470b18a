      "message": "The gain mode should not be used this way: it is used to apply user defined gains, and avoid autodesign to change gain values according to inconsistent power targets. by the way it does not compensate exactly the span loss: this depends on the power target. change to : apply user defined gain and if none is defined, use default target power to compute gain",

      "message": "power mode is independent of per span power optimization, and the range does not exactly correspond to short/long spans, since it depends on loss and not on km. It is also not really proportional to the dB difference, since it adapts to each amp max power. So I think that the inclusion of \"delta_power_range_db\" in this container is misleading and the naming does not make sense. why not keeping the initial names ? \npower-range-optimization-max-value?  or something more close to the current naming?",
