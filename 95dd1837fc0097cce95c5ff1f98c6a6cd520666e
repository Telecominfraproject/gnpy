      "message": "I\u0027ll take your word that this is correct, but I would prefer these changes to be done like this:\n\n1) You discovered that some parameters are wrong. Here it looks that the _beta2 was set with a wrong sign, and this was compensated for in science_utils._frequency_offset_threshold. The sign was wrong because add-your-reasoning-here-because-Jan-has-no-clue. This gets fixed in a separate commit which says all of the above in its commit message.\n\n2) Now that the code doesn\u0027t contain that annoying _beta2_has_wrong_sign bug, you can implement this feature for CD simulation on top of that. That commit should get a Change-Id from this change (https://review.gerrithub.io/c/Telecominfraproject/oopt-gnpy/+/493926).",
