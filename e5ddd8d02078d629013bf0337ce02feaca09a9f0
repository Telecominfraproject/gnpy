      "message": "Why not, but to me that still looks like an arbitrary number, so I\u0027ll be thinking out loud on where this number might come from.\n\nThe worst case topology is an N-node ring where the shortest path between adjacent nodes has length\u003d1, while the only other path has a length\u003dN-1 (OK, that\u0027s a trivial observation, one cannot really have any longer path than crossing each node once). So this is the worst case, and the code tries to avoid bringing the limit to N-1 for some reason.\n\nEsther, when you wrote this, have you done some tests on what the practical limit on a \"typical HW\" is?",
