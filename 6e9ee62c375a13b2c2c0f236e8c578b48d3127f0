      "message": "Maybe it\u0027s ok to remove it but I think we should be careful with removing stuff with the only motivation that it\u0027s not used by our own \"example code\". I guess it relates to the question of what GNPy actually is but if we consider it a library that anyone can use in their code we can\u0027t know if someone is actually using a specific function. So the cost of maintaining it should be weighed against the risk of breaking someones code (I think this risk is currently very low).",
