The json example does not show the difficulty here because it contains only a list of 2 item [0, 2.4] (??), but if we use dgt of current default_edfa_config , it has 96 values that would be listed in each amp !\nOr maybe this is not showing the indirection ?",

      "message": "Right, that version did not contain the indirection that we agreed to; it seems that I never pushed that fixed YANG. However, in light of some recent discussions at the coders calls, I *think* that Vittorio (et al) and Jonas have confirmed that these \"typical values\" that we currently ship do not really match \"all EDFAs\". The way I remember these discussions, the correct approach is to ship with these measurements for all EDFA types that we ship other data for.\n\nBased on that, I would like to revisit our past decision when we decided to store these vectors in a separate list, \"outside of\" the actual amplifier definition (in another YANG list). Now that all EDFA type_varieties will have to have their own vectors, I think that the indirection doesn\u0027t help. Of course I\u0027m open to discussing this, it\u0027s just a proposal from my side. I\u0027m also not happy that I\u0027m essentially proposing revisiting a decision that we made. *If* we agree that there\u0027s a set of default tilt\u0026ripple values which make sense for \"a lot of EDFAs\", then I\u0027ll take this back and just add the indirection back.\n\nRe \"just two elements\" -- the code uses linear interpolation, so specifying the (start, end) pair will just set up a simple linear curve. I wanted to highlight that in the example data. It\u0027s still possible to specify e.g. 96 values which will be uniformly mapped to the standard C-band@50GHz grid.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve changed these to use Hz, not THz, to be aligned with how we have always preferred SI units everywhere in I/O formats. However, I\u0027m a bit undecided on this because I think that reading \"191.35\" is a much clearer than \"191350000000000\", and YANG contains real support for units anyway.\n\nAlso, the YANG-over-JSON says that 191350000000000 (if we use .e.g uint64) *cannot* be represented as a \"191.35e12\". On the other hand, if we go the decimal64 route, it will always require quoting...\n\nPerhaps we could make this into a union of just-the-number-in-Hz or decimal64-in-THz-as-a-string? The rules look like something that is allowed, at least in JSON. In XML the situation could be different because there\u0027s no mandatory quoting of decimal64 in XML...",
