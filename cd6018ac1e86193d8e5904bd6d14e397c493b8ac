      "message": "It would be wrong as PMD is a dispersion coefficient, while DGD is a delay. They are physically different and, here DGD parameter describes the differential group delay contribution added by the ROADM node. If I use a PMD parameter here I should multiply it for sqrt of a length which, for a ROADM node doesn\u0027t make sense.",

      "message": "As PMD is a dispersion coefficient while DGD a delay it wouldn\u0027t make sense to have information on a dispersion coefficient at the receiver. At the DSP you actually have an information on the DGD and not on a PMD. It would be like having the chromatic dispersion instead of the accumulated chromatic dispersion at the receiver.",

      "message": "I disagree with that terminology. PMD can used both as in PMD coefficient (in ps/sqrt(km)) and PMD value (in ps). PMD is a statistical process and the instantaneous DGD (i.e. what is measured by the DSP in the receiver) varies in time and frequency. What is given in line 178 above is the average of the DGD, i.e. the PMD value. See e.g. the definitions in ITU-T recommendation G.650.2:\n\n3.1.4 PMD value: PMD_AVG is defined as the linear average 〈Δτ〉 of the DGD values Δτ(ν) over a\ngiven optical frequency range ν1 to ν2,",
